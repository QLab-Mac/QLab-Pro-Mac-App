## 🧩 Overview  

**QLab Pro for macOS** delivers a powerful and reliable environment for managing multimedia cues across live performances, concerts, film screenings, and immersive installations. Designed by **Figure 53**, it allows complete control over sound, video, and lighting — all from one intuitive interface.  

With its **cue-based architecture**, QLab enables operators to design, trigger, and synchronize complex sequences of media playback in real time. Each cue can control audio files, video projections, MIDI devices, lighting systems, and even external networked gear, offering unparalleled flexibility for show designers and technical directors.  

The Pro version expands these capabilities with advanced video mapping, **multi-display support**, **audio routing tools**, and **MIDI/OSC automation**, allowing professional productions to achieve cinematic precision.  

Fully optimized for **Apple Silicon** and **macOS**, QLab Pro ensures stable performance, low latency, and robust reliability in any live setup. Whether you’re programming a Broadway musical or a local stage show, QLab gives you the creative freedom to focus on storytelling — not on troubleshooting.
